# Multiclass-AL-HSIC-using-ELM-SVM-KNN-LORSAL

## The demo is impemetned unisg Indain Pines Dataset on which KNN and ELM classifiers are traied from the range of 1-20 NN and 1-500 Hiden Neurons.

## The code is partially associated with the following papers: [Spatial Prior Fuzziness Pool-Based Interactive Classification of Hyperspectral Images](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/9/1136) and [Multiclass Non-Randomized Spectral–Spatial Active Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/14/4739)
